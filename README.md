# ⏱️ Duration Calculator

A simple and efficient **Duration Calculator** that helps you calculate the time difference between two date and timestamps or compute total durations across hours and minutes. Ideal for developers, students, project tracking, payroll calculations, and everyday time management.

## 🚀 Features

* Calculate duration between **start date, time and end date, time**
* Supports **hours and minutes**
* Handles **cross-day durations** (e.g., 23:00 → 01:00)
* Clean and easy-to-use interface / logic
* Accurate and lightweight

## 🧮 How It Works

The calculator takes a **start time** and an **end time**, converts them into a uniform format, and computes the difference.

Example:

```
Start Date and Time: 01-01-2026, 10:30 AM
End Date and Time:   02-01-2026, 10:45 PM
Result:  1 day 12 hours 15 minutes
```
